Finally, there is the UIUC flight model, developed by a team at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign. This work was initially geared toward modeling aircraft in icing conditions, but now encompasses “nonlinear” aerodynamics, which result in more
realism in extreme attitudes, such as stall and high angle of attack flight. Two good examples that illustrate this capability are the Airwave Xtreme 150 hang glider and the
1903 Wright Flyer. More details of the UIUC flight model can be found at:
